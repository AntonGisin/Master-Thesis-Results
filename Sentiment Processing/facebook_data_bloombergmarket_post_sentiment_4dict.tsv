Here's what I'm watching today from the Bloomberg Markets daily newsletter, which you can sign up for here: http://bit.ly/1IJLySS  Obviously all eyes will be on tomorrow's Non-Farm Payrolls to see whether the solid pace of U.S. job creation that we've seen so far 2015 continued in September.  Analysts are looking forЕщё 200,000 new jobs in the month, and for the unemployment rate to hold at 5.1 percent. There will of course also be a lot of interest in the average hourly wage growth number. In the meantime, today you should pay attention to last month's auto sales.  All of the major auto manufacturers will be reporting their September results today, and analysts are forecasting annualized sales of 17.6 million vehicles, just shy of last month's 17.72 million.  Any cars sold in September, of course, came after the re-emergence of fierce market volatility, particularly August 24 when markets around the world plunged. Did the big equity drop cause people to pause on making big purchases? We'll get a clue today.	0	0	3.75	2.75	64.5	1.0	71	0.014084507042253521	2	0	87	0.022988505747126436	0	0	87	0.0	0.055	0.043	0.902	0.296

This has been a very strange week or soЕщё for markets, ever since last week's Fed decision to not hike rates.  Despite the Fed being ""dovish,"" risky assets sold off and the dollar strengthened. On the other hand, the market did seem to like comments earlier in the week from various Fed presidents, who stated their preference for a 2015 rate hike. You never want to extrapolate too much from just a few days worth of data, but it does kind of look like stocks want the Fed to just get on with it.  Meanwhile, next week is loaded with top-shelf economic data, such as Personal Income & Spending, Construction Spending, ISM Manufacturing, and the monthly Non-Farm Payrolls report on Friday."	0	0	2.5	1.75	61.75	0.75	66	0.011363636363636364	2	0	76	0.02631578947368421	0	0	76	0.0	0.072	0.029	0.898	0.782

12099	246287648793439	2012-02-25 03:02:58	Thailand is the second hottest emerging market, according to our ranking.  Thailand’s tiny, $303 billion stock market as of Feb. 22 accounts for just 0.6 percent of the market value of world equities. As ofЕщё 2011, its gross domestic product per capita was a mere $5,281, less than half that of Mexico’s. The country is prone to disruptions ranging from coups d’etat and civil strife to tsunamis and floods.  And yet Thailand has developed such successful electronics and auto industries that it now produces from 35 to 40 percent of all computer hard disk drives and, in 2010, built more light trucks than Japan.  In agriculture, besides being the world’s biggest rice exporter, Thailand ranks No. 1 in rubber and No. 2 in sugar. The country that brands itself the Land of Smiles has consistently remained one of the world’s top 20 tourism destinations, attracting more visitors in 2010 than Greece.
